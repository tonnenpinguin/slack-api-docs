In this case, `invalid_channels` contains the channels that could not be added.\n\n```\n{\n    \"ok\": false,\n    \"error\": \"channel_not_found\",\n    \"invalid_channels\": [\"C1234D1R4\", \"C1234D1R5\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou might see a partial success response if you do not have enough permissions to manage all the specified channels, or if some `channel_ids` are not valid, or if the [types of some channels are not supported](#channel_types).",
