Requires [`users:read.email`](/scopes/users:read.email).\n\nCustom bot users cannot use this method.\n\nReturns a [user object](/types/user).\n\n### Profile\n\nThe profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied in the default profile fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `real_name`, `display_name`, `skype`, and the `image_*` fields. Only the `image_*` fields are guaranteed to be included. Data that has not been supplied may not be present at all, may be null or may contain the empty string (\"\").\n\nA user's custom profile fields may be discovered using [`users.profile.get`](/methods/users.profile.get).\n\n### Email addresses\n\n<ts-icon class=\"ts_icon_square_warning\"></ts-icon> **Accessing email addresses**  \nThe [`users:read.email`](/scopes/users:read.email) OAuth scope is now required to access the `email` field in [user objects](/types/user) returned by the [`users.list`](/methods/users.list) and [`users.info`](/methods/users.info) web API methods. [`users:read`](/scopes/users:read) is no longer a sufficient scope for this data field. [Learn more](/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access).\n\nApps created after January 4th, 2017 must explicitly request the `users:read.email` [OAuth permission scope](/docs/oauth-scopes) when using the [OAuth app installation flow](/authentication) to enable access to this method.",
