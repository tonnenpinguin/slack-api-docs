  "desc": "Retrieve a thread of messages posted to a conversation\n\nThis [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method returns a cursor-paginated thread of messages posted to a conversation.\n\nThe scopes and token types required to use this method vary by conversation type.\n\n[Bot user tokens](/docs/token-types#bot) may use this method for direct message and multi-party direct message conversations but lack sufficient permissions to use this method on public and private channels.\n\nTo use `conversations.replies` with public or private channel threads, use a [user token](/docs/token-types#user) with [`channels:history`](/scopes/channels:history) or [`groups:history`](/scopes/groups:history) scopes.\n\nThe `channel` and `ts` arguments are always required. `ts` must be the timestamp of an existing message with 0 or more replies. If there are no replies then just the single message referenced by `ts` will return - it is just an ordinary message.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThis method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.\n\nResponses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.\n\nSee [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.\n\n### Pagination by time\n\nThis form of pagination can be used in conjunction with cursors.\n\nThe `messages` array contains up to 1000 messages between the `oldest` and `latest` timestamps. The earliest messages in the time range are returned first.\n\nIf there were more than 1000 messages between `oldest` and `latest`, then `has_more` will be `true` in the response. In an additional call, set the `ts` value of the final message as `latest` to get the next page of messages.\n\nIf a message has the same timestamp as `oldest` or `latest` it will not be included in the list. This functionality allows you to use the timestamps of specific messages as boundaries for the results. You can, however, have both timestamps be included in the time range by setting `inclusive` to `true`. The `inclusive` parameter is ignored when `oldest` or `latest` is not specified.",
