## Usage info

This [Admin API](/admins) invalidates a **single** session for a user on a workspace. The user will be logged out and forced to login again. If the user has multiple sessions with multiple devices, the other sessions will be unaffected.

If you'd like to reset _all sessions_ for a given user, use the [`admin.users.session.reset`](/methods/admin.users.session.reset) method instead.

This [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
