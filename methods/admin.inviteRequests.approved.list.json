  "desc": "List all approved workspace invite requests.\n\nThis [invite request management API](/enterprise/inviting) method lists workspace invite requests that have already been approved.\n\nThis method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise-grid) admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.invites:read` page](/scopes/admin.invites:read) for more detailed instructions.\n\n`team_id` is **required** if your Enterprise Grid org contains more than one workspace.\n\n```\n{\n        \"ok\": true,\n        \"approved_requests\": [\n            [\n                \"invite_request\": [\n                    \"id\": \"IrNKPK5TK3\",\n                    \"email\": \"foo@example.com\",\n                    \"date_created\": \"1616127454\"\n                    \"requester_ids\": [\n                        \"UNKPK5TJM\"\n                    ],\n                    \"channel_ids\": [\n                        \"CNKPK5TJW\",\n                        \"CNKPK5TJH\"\n                    ],\n                    \"invite_type\": \"full_member\",\n                    \"real_name\": null,\n                    \"date_expire\": null,\n                    \"request_reason\" null\n                ],\n                \"approved_by\": [\n                    \"actor_id\": \"UNKPK5TJB\",\n                    \"actor_type\": \"user\"\n                ],\n                \"invite\": [\n                    \"id\": \"INKPK5TK4\",\n                    \"inviter_id\": \"UNKPK5TJM\",\n                    \"email\": \"foo@example.com\",\n                    \"date_created\": 1616127724,\n                    \"date_resent\": null,\n                    \"is_bouncing\": false,\n                    \"invite_preferences\": [\n                        \"is_restricted\": false,\n                        \"is_ultra_restricted\": false,\n                        \"date_expire\": null,\n                        \"channel_ids\": [\n                            \"CNKPK5TJW\",\n                            \"CNKPK5TJH\"\n                        ],\n                        \"is_domain_matched\": false,\n                        \"real_name\": null\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],  \n            [\n                \"invite_request\": [\n                    \"id\": \"IrNKPK5TG3\",\n                    \"email\": \"foo2@example.com\",\n                    \"date_created\": \"161612723454\"\n                    \"requester_ids\": [\n                        \"UNKPK5TJK\"\n                    ],\n                    \"channel_ids\": [\n                        \"CNKEK5TJS\",\n                        \"CNKPK5TJG\"\n                    ],\n                    \"invite_type\": \"full_member\",\n                    \"real_name\": null,\n                    \"date_expire\": null,\n                    \"request_reason\" null\n                ],\n                \"approved_by\": [\n                    \"actor_id\": \"UNKPK5TJK\",\n                    \"actor_type\": \"user\"\n                ],\n                \"invite\": [\n                    \"id\": \"INKPK5TK4\",\n                    \"inviter_id\": \"UNKPK5TJM\",\n                    \"email\": \"foo2@example.com\",\n                    \"date_created\": 1616127726,\n                    \"date_resent\": null,\n                    \"is_bouncing\": false,\n                    \"invite_preferences\": [\n                        \"is_restricted\": false,\n                        \"is_ultra_restricted\": false,\n                        \"date_expire\": null,\n                        \"channel_ids\": [\n                            \"CNKPK5TJW\",\n                            \"CNKPK5TJH\"\n                        ],\n                        \"is_domain_matched\": false,\n                        \"real_name\": null\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],  \n        ],\n    }\n```",
