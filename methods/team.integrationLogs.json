If it's a service, `service_id` and `service_type` will be returned, and if it's an API application, `app_id` and `app_type` will be returned.\n\nLogs can also contain different `change_types`. The possible types are: `added`, `removed`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `expanded` and `updated`.\n\nIf the log entry is an RSS feed, the log will also contain `rss_feed` (with a value of `true`), `rss_feed_change_type`, `rss_feed_title` and `rss_feed_url`.\n\nWhen a `disabled` event is logged, its log entry will also contain a `reason` for why the event occurred. The list of possible reasons are:\n\n- `user` - Manually disabled by user\n- `rate_limits` - Rate limits exceeded\n- `slack` - Disabled by Slack\n- `errors` - Too many errors\n- `system` - A system change (i.e. channel archived)\n- `admin` - Admin (i.e. user deleted)\n- `api_decline` - User declined the API TOS\n- `deauth` - Service de-authorized\n\nThe paging information contains the `count` of logs returned, the `total` number of logs, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available.",
