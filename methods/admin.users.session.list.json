  "desc": "List active user sessions for an organization\n\nThis [Admin API](/admins) lists active login sessions to your Slack organization.\n\nIf no `user_id` and `team_id` are passed, you'll receive a paginated list of _all_ sessions.\n\nWhen you pass `user_id` and `team_id` (which must be used together), you'll receive a list of active sessions by that user on the workspace specified by `team_id`.\n\nThese sessions can be used to reset a session with the [`invalidate` method](/methods/admin.users.session.invalidate): the user will be logged out and forced to login again. If the user has multiple sessions with multiple devices, the other sessions will be unaffected.\n\nIf you'd like to reset _all sessions_ for a given user, use the [`admin.users.session.reset`](/methods/admin.users.session.reset) method instead.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\nInside an `active_session`, you'll find two objects: `recent` and `created`.\n\n`recent` signifies the most recent version of the session, while `created` represents the original version of the session. This covers the case where the same session persists across multiple `slack_client_version`s (or OS versions or IPs).\n\nIf the session hasn't changed since creation, you'll **only** find `created` and not `recent`.\n\nBoth `recent` and `created` contain the following info:\n\n- `device_hardware`: The type of device for the session.\n- `os`: The operating system for the device.\n- `os_version`: The version of the OS.\n- `slack_client_version`: The version of the Slack client, if available.\n- `ip`: The IP address for the session.",
