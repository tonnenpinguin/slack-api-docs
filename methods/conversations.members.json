To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.\n\nResponses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.\n\nSee [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.",
