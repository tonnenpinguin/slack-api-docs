  "desc": "List all denied workspace invite requests.\n\nThis [invite request management API](/enterprise/inviting) method lists workspace invite requests that have already been denied.\n\nThis method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise Grid admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.invites:read` page](/scopes/admin.invites:read) for more detailed instructions.\n\n`team_id` is **required** if your Enterprise Grid org contains more than one workspace.\n\n```\n{\n    \"ok\": true,\n    \"denied_requests\": [\n        {\n            \"invite_request\": {\n                \"id\": \"Ir0P0Z6SKD\",\n                \"email\": \"example1@slack-corp.com\",\n                \"date_created\": 1569863763,\n                \"requester_ids\": [\n                    \"W0GBAEJKD\"\n                ],\n                \"channel_ids\": [\n                    \"C0GU730DQ\",\n                    \"C0U9WES0Y\"\n                ],\n                \"is_restricted\": false,\n                \"is_ultra_restricted\": false,\n                \"real_name\": \"Example\",\n                \"date_expire\": null,\n                \"request_reason\": null\n            },\n            \"denied_by\": {\n                \"actor_type\": \"app\",\n                \"actor_id\": \"A00\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"invite_request\": {\n                \"id\": \"Ir0GL738RY\",\n                \"email\": \"example2@slack-corp.com\",\n                \"date_created\": 1564016487,\n                \"requester_ids\": [\n                    \"W0GAAFJKD\"\n                ],\n                \"channel_ids\": [\n                    \"G06LHQYCS\",\n                    \"G0BMCEY2W\",\n                    \"C0GLJ30DQ\",\n                    \"C0U9RQS0Y\"\n                ],\n                \"is_restricted\": false,\n                \"is_ultra_restricted\": false,\n                \"real_name\": \"seesijkdswsss\",\n                \"date_expire\": null,\n                \"request_reason\": null\n            },\n            \"denied_by\": {\n                \"actor_type\": \"user\",\n                \"actor_id\": \"W0GAAUJKD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"response_metadata\": {\n        \"next_cursor\": \"ZGF0ZV9jcmVhdGU6MTU2MTc0Nzc2Ng==\"\n    }\n}\n```",
