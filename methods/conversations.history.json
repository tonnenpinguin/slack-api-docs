  "desc": "Fetches a conversation's history of messages and events.\n\nThis method returns a portion of [message events](/events/message) from the specified conversation.\n\nTo read the entire history for a conversation, call the method with no `oldest` or `latest` arguments, and then continue paging using the instructions below.\n\nThe scopes and token types required to use this method vary by conversation type:\n\n- Apps using [classic bot user token](/docs/token-types#bot) may use this method for direct message and multi-party direct message conversations but lack sufficient permissions to use this method on public and private channels.\n- Every other type of token can be used with this method for any conversations the relevant app, bot, or user is a member of. The calling app must also have the relevant [`*:history` scope](/scopes) for the conversation type.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThis method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.\n\nResponses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.\n\nSee [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.\n\n### Pagination by time\n\nThis form of pagination can be used in conjunction with cursors.\n\nThe `messages` array contains up to 100 messages between the `oldest` and `latest` timestamps. The most recent messages in the time range are returned first.\n\nIf there were more than 100 messages between `oldest` and `latest`, then `has_more` will be `true` in the response. In an additional call, set the `ts` value of the final message as `latest` to get the next page of messages.\n\nIf a message has the same timestamp as `oldest` or `latest` it will not be included in the list. This functionality allows you to use the timestamps of specific messages as boundaries for the results. You can, however, have both timestamps be included in the time range by setting `inclusive` to `true`. The `inclusive` parameter is ignored when `oldest` or `latest` is not specified.\n\n### Retrieving a single message\n\n`conversations.history` can also be used to pluck a single message from the archive.\n\nYou'll need a message's `ts` value, uniquely identifying it within a conversation. You'll also need that conversation's ID.\n\nIf you know the `ts` of a specific message:\n\n1. Set `oldest` to the `ts`\n2. Set `inclusive` to `true`\n3. Set `limit` to 1\n\nIf you know the `ts` of the message that is before or after of the specific message you're looking for; set `inclusive` to `false` and use the `oldest` or `latest` value respectively.\n\nProvide another message's `ts` value _as_ the `latest` parameter. Set `limit` to `1`. If it exists, you'll receive the queried message in return.\n\nFinally, use `inclusive=true` because otherwise we'll never retrieve the message we're actually after, just the ones that come after it.\n\n```\nGET /api/conversations.history?channel=C2EB2QT8A&latest=1476909142.000007&inclusive=true&limit=1\nAuthorization: Bearer TOKEN_WITH_CHANNELS_HISTORY_SCOPE\n```\n\nTo retrieve a message from a thread, check out [`conversation.replies`](/messaging/retrieving#pulling_threads).\n\nYou can easily generate a permalink URL for any specific message using [`chat.getPermalink`](/methods/chat.getPermalink).\n\n* * *\n\n## Message types\n\nMessages of type `\"message\"` are user-entered text messages sent to the channel, while other types are events that happened within the channel. All messages have both a `type` and a sortable `ts`, but the other fields depend on the `type`. For a list of all possible events, see the [channel messages](/events/message) documentation.\n\nMessages that have been reacted to by team members will have a [reactions](/events/message#stars __pins__ and_reactions) array delightfully included.\n\nIf a message has been starred by the calling user, the `is_starred` property will be present and true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.\n\nThe `is_limited` boolean property is only included for free teams that have reached the free message limit. If true, there are messages before the current result set, but they are beyond the message limit.",
