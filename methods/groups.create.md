**Information about required scopes**  
This [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method's required scopes depend on the type of channel-like object you're working with. To use the method, you'll need at least one of the `channels:`, `groups:`, `im:` or `mpim:` scopes corresponding to the conversation type you're working with.

## Usage info

Create a public or private channel using this [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method.

Use [`conversations.open`](/methods/conversations.open) to initiate or resume a direct message or multi-person direct message.

## Naming

Channel names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and must be 80 characters or less. When calling this method, we recommend storing both the channel's `id` and `name` value that returned in the response.

Channel names are always validated by this method, unlike [`channels.create`](/methods/channels.create).

## Example responses

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
