## Arguments

Required arguments

`token`

[token](/authentication/token-types)

_路_Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**Example**
`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

`app_id`

string

_路_Required

The ID of the app to uninstall.

**Example**
`A12345`

Optional arguments

`enterprise_id`

string

_路_Optional

The enterprise to completely uninstall the application from (across all workspaces). With an org-level token, this or `team_ids` is required.

**Example**
`E12345`

`team_ids`

string

_路_Optional

IDs of the teams to uninstall from (max 100). With an org-level token, this or `enterprise_id` is required.

## Usage info

This endpoint will uninstall an app from one or many workspaces, or an entire enterprise.

Exactly one of the arguments `enterprise_id` or `team_ids` is required to specify where the app should be removed.

Admin apps that work with [SCIM](/admins/scim), [app management](/admins/approvals), or certain other enterprise-level features cannot be uninstalled using this API. To remove one of those, please [contact support](mailto:devsupport@slack.com).

This [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).

Uninstalling an app **cannot be undone**. Once an application is uninstalled, users must reinstall it manually if they wish to restore it.

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
