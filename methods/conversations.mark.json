  "desc": "Sets the read cursor in a channel.\n\nThis method moves the read cursor in a conversation for whomever owns the token used in the request. We don't know why bot users would want to move their read cursor but it can be done.\n\nThe associated user must be a member of the channel.\n\nAfter making this call, the mark is saved to the database and broadcast via the message server to all open connections for the calling user.\n\nDon't make calls to this method very often. When needing to mark a read position, a client should set a timer before making the call. In this way, any further updates needed during the timeout will not generate extra calls (just one per channel). This is useful for when reading scroll-back history, or following a busy live channel. A timeout of 5 seconds is a good starting point.",
