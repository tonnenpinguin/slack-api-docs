## Usage info

This [App Management API](/admins/approvals) method clears an app resoluton set for an app on a specific workspace or enterprise, undoing the effect of `admin.apps.approve` or `admin.apps.restrict`.

This method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise Grid admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:write` page](/scopes/admin.apps:write) for more detailed instructions.

This [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).

Exactly one of the `team_id` or `enterprise_id` arguments is required, not both. Providing an `enterprise_id` clears the resolution at the enterprise level, not on each of the enterprise's workspaces. The `team_id` clears the resolution on a single workspace.

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
