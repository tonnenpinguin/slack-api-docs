## Usage info

Easily exchange a message timestamp and a channel ID for a friendly HTTP-based permalink to that message. Handles [message threads](/docs/message-threading) and all [conversation types](/types/conversation).

## Rate limiting

This method allows hundreds of requests per minute. Use it more or less as often as required, but please obey HTTP 429 _Too Many Requests_ status codes and wait to retry. Please consult [rate limits](/docs/rate-limits) for more information.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Standard success response

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "channel": "C1H9RESGA",
    "permalink": "https://ghostbusters.slack.com/archives/C1H9RESGA/p135854651500008"
}
```

### Alternate response

When the provided `message_ts` is part of a thread, the permalink format changes.

```
{

    "channel": "C1H9RESGA",
    "permalink": "https://ghostbusters.slack.com/archives/C1H9RESGL/p135854651700023?thread_ts=1358546515.000008&cid=C1H9RESGL"
}
```

### Common error response

Error response when channel cannot be found

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "channel_not_found"
}
```

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
