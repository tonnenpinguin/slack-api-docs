## Usage info

This [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).

You may also receive a "partial" success response when some of the provided channels in the `channel_ids` are removed successfully. In this case, `invalid_channels` contains the channels that could not be removed.

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "channel_not_found",
    "invalid_channels": ["C1234D1R4", "C1234D1R5"]
}
```

You might see a partial success if you do not have enough permissions to manage all the specified channels, or if some `channel_ids` are not valid, or if the types of some channels are not supported.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Typical success response

```
{
    "ok": true
}
```

### Common error response

Typical error response if the token provided is not associated with an Org Admin or Owner

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "not_an_admin"
}
```

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
