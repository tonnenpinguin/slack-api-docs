  "desc": "Search for public or private channels in an Enterprise organization.\n\nThis [Admin API method](/admins) searches for channels across an organization given a search query.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\nThis `admin` scope is obtained through [version two of the OAuth V2 flow](/authentication/oauth-v2), but there are a few additional requirements. The app requesting this scope **must** be [installed](/start/overview#installing_distributing) by an _ **admin or Owner** _ of an Enterprise Grid organization. Also, the app must be installed on the **entire** org, not on an individual workspace. See below for more details.\n\nIf the app is installed by an Org Admin or Owner, ensure the Channel Management settings provide the appropriate permissions.\n\nAdmin API endpoints reach across **an entire Enterprise Grid organization** , not individual workspaces.\n\nFor a token to be imbued with Admin scopes, it must be obtained from installing an app on the **entire Grid org** , not just a workspace within the organization.\n\nTo configure and install an app supporting Admin API endpoints on your Enterprise Grid organization:\n\n1. [Create a new Slack app](/apps). Your app will need to be able to handle a standard [OAuth 2 flow](/docs/oauth#flow).\n2. In the app's settings, select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left navigation. Scroll down to the section titled **Scopes** and add the `admin.*` scope you want. Click the green **Save Changes** button.\n3. In the app's settings, select **Manage Distribution** from the left navigation. Under the section titled **Share Your App with Other Workspaces** , make sure all four sections have the green check. Then click the green **Activate Public Distribution** button.\n4. Under the **Share Your App with Your Workspace** section, copy the **Sharable URL** and paste it into a browser to initiate the OAuth handshake that will install the app on your organization. You must be logged in as an **admin or Owner** of your Enterprise Grid organization to install the app.\n5. Check the dropdown in the upper right of the installation screen to make sure you are installing the app on the organization, not an individual workspace within the organization. See the image below for a visual.\n6. Once your app completes the OAuth flow, you will be granted an OAuth token that can be used for calling Admin API methods for your organization.\n ![](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/api/workspace-v-org-audit.png)\n_When installing an app to use an Admin API endpoint, be sure to install it on your Grid organization, not a workspace within the organization._\n\n### More on channel types \n\nThe `search_channel_types` allows an array of types to be passed, each of which filters the channels that the search returns. If you pass multiple types, the search occurs in channels that satisfy **any** of the types. You can pass the following values in your list of `search_channel_types`:\n\n- `private`\n- `private_exclude`\n- `archived`\n- `exclude_archived`\n- `private_exclude_archived`\n- `multi_workspace`\n- `org_wide`\n- `external_shared_exclude`\n- `external_shared`\n- `external_shared_private`\n- `external_shared_archived`\n\n`private` will search private channels, and `private_exclude` will exclude them from the search. The other names follow the same patterns for channels connected to other organizations and archived channels.\n\nThe `member_count` field may return `-1` when the count cannot be retrieved for performance reasons. Counts of `0` and above indicate current membership.",
