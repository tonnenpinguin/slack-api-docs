## Arguments

Required arguments

`token`

[token](/authentication/token-types)

_·_Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**Example**
`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

Optional arguments

`user`

string

_·_Optional

User to get presence info on. Defaults to the authed user.

**Example**
`W1234567890`

## Usage info

This method lets you find out information about a user's presence.[Consult the presence documentation](/docs/presence) for more details.

`presence` indicates the user's overall presence, it will either be `active` or `away`.

`online` will be true if they have a client currently connected to Slack. `auto_away` will be true if our servers haven't detected any activity from the user in the last 10 minutes. `manual_away` will be true if the user has manually set their presence to `away`.

`connection_count` gives a count of total connections.

`last_activity` indicates the last activity seen by our servers. If a user has no connected clients then this property will be absent.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

When requesting information for a different user, this method just returns the current presence (either `active` or `away`).

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "presence": "active"
}
```

### Alternate response

If you are requesting presence information for the authed user, this method returns the current presence, along with details on how it was calculated.

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "presence": "active",
    "online": true,
    "auto_away": false,
    "manual_away": false,
    "connection_count": 1,
    "last_activity": 1419027078
}
```

### Common error response

Typical error response

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "invalid_auth"
}
```

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
