  "desc": "Updates a message.\n\nThis method updates a message in a channel. Though related to [`chat.postMessage`](/methods/chat.postMessage), some parameters of `chat.update` are handled differently.\n\nEphemeral messages created by [`chat.postEphemeral`](/methods/chat.postEphemeral) or otherwise cannot be updated with this method.\n\nNew Slack apps may use this method with the [`chat:write`](/scopes/chat:write) scope and either a bot or user token.\n\nTo define your message, refer to our [formatting spec](/reference/surfaces/formatting) and our guide to [composing messages](/messaging/composing).\n\n## Valid message types\n\nOnly messages posted by the authenticated user are able to be updated using this method. This includes regular chat messages, as well as messages containing the `me_message` subtype. [Bot users](/bot-users) may also update the messages they post.\n\nAttempting to update other message types will return a `cant_update_message` error.\n\nTo use `chat.update` with a [bot user](/bot-users) token, you'll need to _think of your bot user as a user_, and pass `as_user` set to `true` while editing a message created by that same bot user.\n\nThe response includes the `text`, `channel` and `timestamp` properties of the updated message so clients can keep their local copies of the message in sync.\n\n### Updating interactive messages\n\nIf you're posting an [interactive message](/messaging/interactivity), you may use `chat.update` to continue updating ongoing state changes around a message. Provide the `ts` field the message you're updating and follow the bot user instructions above to update message text, and remove or add blocks.",
