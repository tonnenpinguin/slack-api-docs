  "desc": "Searches for messages and files matching a query.\n\nThis method allows users and applications to search both messages and files in a single call.\n\nThe response returns matches broken down by their type of content, similar to the facebook/gmail auto-completed search widgets.\n\nWhen using a user token with this method, search results will be affected by the search filters set in the Slack UI.\n\nWithin each content group, data is returned in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"matches\": [],\n    \"paging\": {\n        \"count\": 100,\n        \"total\": 15,\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"pages\": 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `count` - number of records per page\n- `total` - total records matching query\n- `page` - page of records returned\n- `pages` - total pages matching query\n\nThis block gives the (estimated) total number of matches of this type, then has an array containing the specified page of the top matches. The format of matches depends on the match type, as described in the documentation for[search.messages](/methods/search.messages) and [search.files](/methods/search.files). These methods can be used to fetch further pages of messages or files.",
