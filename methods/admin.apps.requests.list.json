  "desc": "List app requests for a team/workspace.\n\nThis [App Management API](/admins/approvals) method lists pending app install requests for a workspace. It only lists requests for installation that have not yet been [approved](/methods/admin.apps.approve) or [restricted](/methods/admin.apps.restrict).\n\nThis method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise Grid admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:read` page](/scopes/admin.apps:read) for more detailed instructions.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\n`team_id` is **required** if your Enterprise Grid org contains more than one workspace.\n\nThe `is_user_app_collaborator` response field for each request may be used to determine whether the installer is also a collaborator on the app.\n\nThe `developer_type` in each app helpfully describes its origin.\n\n- `internal` - the app was developed as part of this enterprise grid or workspace\n- `third_party` - the app was developed by a third party, such as (but not limited to) those found in the [Slack app directory](https://slack.com/apps).\n- `slack` - the app was built with love by Slack.
