  "desc": "Open a dialog with a user\n\nOpen a dialog with a user by exchanging a `trigger_id` received from another interaction. See the [dialogs](/dialogs) documentation to learn how to obtain triggers define form elements.\n\nAs with all of our Web API methods, `dialog.open` primarily takes URL-encoded parameters as arguments. Similar to [`chat.postMessage`](/methods/chat.postMessage), [`chat.unfurl`](/methods/chat.unful), and [`chat.update`](/methods/chat.update) this method also includes a parameter that expects a JSON object encoded with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\nA simple form you might create could be modeled in JSON as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"callback_id\": \"ryde-46e2b0\",\n  \"title\": \"Request a Ride\",\n  \"submit_label\": \"Request\",\n  \"state\": \"Limo\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"label\": \"Pickup Location\",\n      \"name\": \"loc_origin\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"label\": \"Dropoff Location\",\n      \"name\": \"loc_destination\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo prepare that as a HTTP POST to `dialog.open`, you'd optionally minify and then URL encode that JSON to a single string, displayed below as the value for the `dialog` POST body parameter.\n\n```\nPOST /api/dialog.open\ntoken=xoxb-such-and-such\n&trigger_id=13345224609.738474920.8088930838d88f008e0\n&dialog=%7B%22callback_id%22%3A%22ryde-46e2b0%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Request%20a%20Ride%22%2C%22submit_label%22%3A%22Request%22%2C%22state%22%3A%22Limo%22%2C%22elements%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22text%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Pickup%20Location%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22loc_origin%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22text%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Dropoff%20Location%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22loc_destination%22%7D%5D%7D\n```\n\nYou can avoid this nonsense by [posting JSON instead](/web#posting_json).\n\nAssuming your submitted dialog elements were properly formatted, valid, and the `trigger_id` was viable, you will receive a minimal success response.\n\nIf your form was invalid, Slack will try to provide a detailed accounting of why and provide the `validation_errors` error. Look for the `response_metadata` node and the `messages` array contained within for human-readable validation errors.\n\nWhen we encounter an error with a specific form element, we'll indicate which element by a zero-indexed `integer`: `0` indicates the first provided element, `1` the second, and so on.",
