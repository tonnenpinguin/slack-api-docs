  "desc": "Retrieve a team's profile.\n\nThis method is used to get the profile field definitions for this team.\n\nThe optional `visibility` argument allows the client to filter the profile fields based on visibility. The following values are supported:\n\n- `all` is the default, and returns all fields.\n- `visible` returns only fields for which the `is_hidden` option is missing or false.\n- `hidden` returns only fields for which the `is_hidden` option is true.\n\nThe response contains a `profile` item with an array of key value pairs. Right now only the `fields` key is supported, which contains a list of field definitions for this team.\n\nThere are two ways to update a field. The value of `is_scim` determines which method to use:\n\n- If `is_scim` is `True`, update the field via a SCIM API call\n- If `is_scim` is `False`, update the field via [`users.profile.set`](/methods/users.profile.set). You'll need its `id` to do so.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | The ID of either the section or field |\n| `is_protected` | Boolean | |\n| `is_scim` | Boolean | If true, can be updated via SCIM APIs |\n| `field_name` | String | The name of the field |\n| `hint` | String | Any additional context the user may need to understand the field |\n| `label` | String | The text that will appear under the field or section |\n| `possible_values` | String | The values that allowed to be chosen by the user |\n| `options` | String | An object containing the `is_protected` and `is_scim` fields |\n| `ordering` | Integer | The placement of the field or section on the profile |\n| `section_id` | String | The `id` of the section the field is in |\n| `section_type` | String | The type of content in the section. Users can only create `custom` section types |\n| `type` | String | The format the field supports. Can be `file`, `text`, `user` and ... |",
