  "desc": "Uploads or creates a file.\n\nThis method allows you to create or upload an existing file.\n\n**You must provide either a `file` or `content` parameter.**\n\nThe content of the file can either be posted using an `enctype` of `multipart/form-data` (with the file parameter named `file`), in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser, or the content of the file can be sent as a POST var called `content`. The latter should be used for creating a \"file\" from a long message/paste and forces \"editable\" mode.\n\nIn both cases, the type of data in the file will be intuited from the filename and the magic bytes in the file, for supported formats.\n\nSending a valid `filetype` parameter will override this behavior. Possible `filetype` values can be found in the [`file` object definition](/types/file#file_types).\n\nFiles uploaded via `multipart/form-data` will be stored either in hosted or editable mode, based on certain heuristics (determined type, file size).\n\nThe file can also be shared directly into channels on upload, by specifying an optional argument `channels`. If there's more than one channel name or ID in the `channels` string, they should be comma-separated. The owner of the token used to upload the file must also be a member of any channel you wish to post to this way.\n\nThere is a 1 megabyte file size limit for files uploaded as snippets.\n\nUpload files and images into [message threads](/docs/message-threading) by providing the thread parent's `ts` value with the `thread_ts` parameter.\n\nThe `initial_comment` field is used in messages to introduce the file in conversation.\n\nIf you only specify a `filename`, we remove the file extension and populate the file's `title` with the remaining value. So, if you want the file's extension to be shown in Slack, you must include it in the `title` argument when uploading it.\n\nBy default all newly-uploaded files are private and only visible to the owner. They become public once they are shared into a public channel (which can happen at upload time via the `channels` argument).\n\nIf successful, the response will include a [file object](/types/file).\n\n## Examples\n\nUpload \"dramacat.gif\" from the current directory and share it in two channels, using `multipart/form-data`:\n\n```\ncurl -F file=@dramacat.gif -F \"initial_comment=Shakes the cat\" -F channels=C024BE91L,D032AC32T -H \"Authorization: Bearer xoxb-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx\" https://slack.com/api/files.upload\n```\n\nCreate an editable text file containing the text \"launch plan\":\n\n```\ncurl -F \"content=launch plan\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer xoxb-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx\" https://slack.com/api/files.upload\n```\n\nUpload another image to an existing message thread:\n\n```\ncurl -F file=@drworm.gif -F \"initial_comment=I play the drums.\" -F channels=C024BE91L -F thread_ts=1532293503.000001 -H \"Authorization: Bearer xoxp-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx\" https://slack.com/api/files.upload\n```",
