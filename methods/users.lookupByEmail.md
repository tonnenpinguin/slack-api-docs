## Arguments

Required arguments

`token`

[token](/authentication/token-types)

_·_Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**Example**
`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

`email`

string

_·_Required

An email address belonging to a user in the workspace

**Example**
`spengler@ghostbusters.example.com`

## Usage info

Retrieve a single user by looking them up by their registered email address. Requires [`users:read.email`](/scopes/users:read.email).

Custom bot users cannot use this method.

Returns a [user object](/types/user).

### Profile

The profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied in the default profile fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `real_name`, `display_name`, `skype`, and the `image_*` fields. Only the `image_*` fields are guaranteed to be included. Data that has not been supplied may not be present at all, may be null or may contain the empty string ("").

A user's custom profile fields may be discovered using [`users.profile.get`](/methods/users.profile.get).

### Email addresses

**Accessing email addresses**  
The [`users:read.email`](/scopes/users:read.email) OAuth scope is now required to access the `email` field in [user objects](/types/user) returned by the [`users.list`](/methods/users.list) and [`users.info`](/methods/users.info) web API methods. [`users:read`](/scopes/users:read) is no longer a sufficient scope for this data field. [Learn more](/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access).

Apps created after January 4th, 2017 must explicitly request the `users:read.email` [OAuth permission scope](/docs/oauth-scopes) when using the [OAuth app installation flow](/authentication) to enable access to this method.

 |
| `invalid_arg_name` | 
The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of accepted or expected values. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call.
 |
| `invalid_array_arg` | 
The method was passed an array as an argument. Please only input valid strings.
 |
| `invalid_charset` |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
