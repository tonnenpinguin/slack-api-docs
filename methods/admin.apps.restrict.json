  "desc": "Restrict an app for installation on a workspace.\n\nThis [App Management API](/admins/approvals) method denies an app install request, restricts an app for a specific workspace, or restricts an app across an entire enterprise. When restricted for the enterprise, an app can not be independently [approved](/methods/admin.apps.approve) on particular workspaces, and any existing workspace-level approvals are voided. Restricting an app does not remove existing installations of the app, it only prevents future installation.\n\nThis method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise Grid admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:write` page](/scopes/admin.apps:write) for more detailed instructions.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\nExactly one of the `team_id` or `enterprise_id` arguments is required, not both.\n\nEither `app_id` or `request_id` is required. These IDs can be obtained either directly via the [`app_requested` event](/events/app_requested), or by the [`admin.apps.requests.list` method](/methods/admin.apps.requests.list).\n\n```\n{\n\t\t\"ok\": true\n\t}\n```",
