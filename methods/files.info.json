  "desc": "Gets information about a file.\n\nThis method returns information about a file in your team.\n\nThe response contains a [file object](/types/file), and a list of comment objects followed by paging information.\n\nThe [file object](/types/file) contains information about the uploaded file.\n\nEach comment object in the comments array contains details about a single comment. Comments are returned oldest first.\n\nThe paging information contains the `count` of comments returned, the `total` number of comments, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available. Please note that the max `count` value is `1000` and the max `page` value is `100`.\n\n[Bot user tokens](/bot-users) may use this method to access information about files appearing in the channels they belong to.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThis method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.\n\nResponses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.\n\nSee [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.",
