  "desc": "List all disconnected channels—i.e., channels that were once connected to other workspaces and then disconnected—and the corresponding original channel IDs for key revocation with EKM.\n\nThis method only applies to Enterprise Grid organizations using [Enterprise Key Management](https://slack.com/help/articles/360019110974-Slack-Enterprise-Key-Management) with [Slack Connect](/apis/channels-between-orgs) channels.\n\nThis [Admin API method](/enterprise/managing) returns the **original connected channel IDs** used for EKM encryption keys.\n\nUse this method if you wish to revoke keys on read-only (_frozen_) channels. Frozen channels can be created when a channel shared with another organization is subsequently disconnected.\n\nWhen used with the `team_ids` parameter, this method will return **all read-only (frozen) channels** and their corresponding original `channel_ids` on the provided workspaces.\n\nWhen used with the `channel_ids` parameter, this method will filter its response, returning the specific original channel IDs requested for the given frozen channels.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\nThis `admin` scope is obtained through [version two of the OAuth V2 flow](/authentication/oauth-v2), but there are a few additional requirements. The app requesting this scope **must** be [installed](/start/overview#installing_distributing) by an _ **admin or Owner** _ of an Enterprise Grid organization. Also, the app must be installed on the **entire** org, not on an individual workspace. See below for more details.\n\nIf the app is installed by an Org Admin or Owner, ensure the Channel Management settings provide the appropriate permissions.\n\nAdmin API endpoints reach across **an entire Enterprise Grid organization** , not individual workspaces.\n\nFor a token to be imbued with Admin scopes, it must be obtained from installing an app on the **entire Grid org** , not just a workspace within the organization.\n\nTo configure and install an app supporting Admin API endpoints on your Enterprise Grid organization:\n\n1. [Create a new Slack app](/apps). Your app will need to be able to handle a standard [OAuth 2 flow](/docs/oauth#flow).\n2. In the app's settings, select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left navigation. Scroll down to the section titled **Scopes** and add the `admin.*` scope you want. Click the green **Save Changes** button.\n3. In the app's settings, select **Manage Distribution** from the left navigation. Under the section titled **Share Your App with Other Workspaces** , make sure all four sections have the green check. Then click the green **Activate Public Distribution** button.\n4. Under the **Share Your App with Your Workspace** section, copy the **Sharable URL** and paste it into a browser to initiate the OAuth handshake that will install the app on your organization. You must be logged in as an **admin or Owner** of your Enterprise Grid organization to install the app.\n5. Check the dropdown in the upper right of the installation screen to make sure you are installing the app on the organization, not an individual workspace within the organization. See the image below for a visual.\n6. Once your app completes the OAuth flow, you will be granted an OAuth token that can be used for calling Admin API methods for your organization.\n ![](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/api/workspace-v-org-audit.png)\n_When installing an app to use an Admin API endpoint, be sure to install it on your Grid organization, not a workspace within the organization._",
