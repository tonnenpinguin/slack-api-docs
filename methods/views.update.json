See the [modals](/surfaces/modals/using#updating_apis) documentation to learn more about updating views and avoiding race conditions with the `hash` argument.\n\n**Preserving `input` entry**  \n\nData entered or selected in `input` blocks can be preserved while updating views. The new `view` object that you use with `views.update` should contain the same input blocks and elements with identical `block_id` and `action_id` values.\n\nIf you pass a valid `view` object along with a `view_id` or `external_id`, you'll receive a success response with the updated payload.",
