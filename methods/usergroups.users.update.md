## Usage info

This method updates the list of users that belong to a User Group. This method replaces all users in a User Group with the list of users provided in the `users` parameter.

You can’t use this method to remove all members from a User Group. Use the [`usergroups.disable`](/methods/usergroups.disable) method instead. If you need to reactive the usergroup later, you can use the [`usergroups.enable`](/methods/usergroups.enable) method.

Guests and bot users may not be part of a User Group.

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
