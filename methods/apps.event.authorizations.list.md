## Usage info

This method returns a list of authorizations for the given event specified by `event_context`. Each authorization represents an app installation that the event is visible to.

### How do I find an `event_context` to call this method with? 

You'll receive an `event_context` identifying an event in each [event payload](/events-api#begin) sent to your app.

### What do authorizations signify? 

Authorizations are **installations of your app**. If your app has been installed multiple times, you'll probably have multiple authorizations for some events.

### When should I call this method? 

Call this method to see all the installations of your app than an event is visible to. Sometimes, only certain installations have permission to know about an event.

### How do I get permission to call this method 

Calling this method is just like any other [Web API](/web) method. However, since this method lists **multiple installations** of your app, you'll need an **app-level token**.

An app-level token represents your app as a _whole_, not just a single installation.

You'll obtain that app-level token by going to your [app config](/apps) and scrolling down to the App-Level Tokens section on the **Basic Information** page. You can click `Generate Token and Scopes` to get the token representing your app as a whole. At the same time, you'll request the [`authorizations:read`](/scopes/authorizations:read) scope.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Typical success response

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "authorizations": [
        {
            "enterprise_id": "string",
            "team_id": "string",
            "user_id": "string",

            "is_bot": "string2"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `internal_error` | 
The server could not complete your operation(s) without encountering an error, likely due to a transient issue on our end. It's possible some aspect of the operation succeeded before the error was raised.
 |
| `invalid_cursor` | 
The `cursor` argument was invalid.
 |
| `invalid_event_context` | 
The given `event_context` didn't match an event.
 |
| `auth_mismatch` | 
The given authorization token is not associated with the app that sent this event.
 |
| `not_authed` | 
No authentication token provided.
 |
| `invalid_auth` | 
Some aspect of authentication cannot be validated. Either the provided token is invalid or the request originates from an IP address disallowed from making the request.
 |
| `access_denied` | 
Access to a resource specified in the request is denied.
 |
| `account_inactive` | 
Authentication token is for a deleted user or workspace when using a `bot` token.
 |
| `token_revoked` | 
Authentication token is for a deleted user or workspace or the app has been removed when using a `user` token.
 |
| `token_expired` | 
Authentication token has expired
 |
| `no_permission` | 
The workspace token used in this request does not have the permissions necessary to complete the request. Make sure your app is a member of the conversation it's attempting to post a message to.
 |
| `org_login_required` | 
The workspace is undergoing an enterprise migration and will not be available until migration is complete.
 |
| `ekm_access_denied` | 
Administrators have suspended the ability to post a message.
 |
| `missing_scope` | 
The token used is not granted the specific scope permissions required to complete this request.
 |
| `not_allowed_token_type` | 
The token type used in this request is not allowed.
 |
| `method_deprecated` | 
The method has been deprecated.
 |
| `deprecated_endpoint` | 
The endpoint has been deprecated.
 |
| `two_factor_setup_required` | 
Two factor setup is required.
 |
| `enterprise_is_restricted` | 
The method cannot be called from an Enterprise.
 |
| `is_bot` | 
This method cannot be called by a bot user.
 |
| `invalid_arguments` | 
The method was either called with invalid arguments or some detail about the arguments passed are invalid, which is more likely when using complex arguments like blocks or attachments.
 |
| `invalid_arg_name` | 
The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of accepted or expected values. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call.
 |
| `invalid_array_arg` | 
The method was passed an array as an argument. Please only input valid strings.
 |
| `invalid_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`.
 |

The method was called via a `POST` request and included a data payload, but the request did not include a `Content-Type` header.

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
