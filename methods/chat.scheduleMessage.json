  "desc": "Schedules a message to be sent to a channel.\n\nThis method schedules [a message](/docs/messages) for delivery to a public channel, private channel, or direct message/IM channel at a specified time in the future.\n\nThe `post_at` argument is a Unix timestamp, representing the time the message should post to Slack in the future.\n\nWith the exception of the additional `post_at` argument, this method behaves identically to [`chat.postMessage`](/methods/chat.postMessage). Peruse that page for in-depth documentation on each parameter that this method accepts.\n\nThe usage of the `text` field changes depending on whether you're using `blocks`. If you are using `blocks`, this is used as a fallback string to display in notifications. If you aren't, this is the main body text of the message. It can be formatted as plain text, or with `mrkdwn`.\n\n## Restrictions \n\nYou will only be able to schedule a message up to 120 days into the future. If you specify a `post_at` timestamp beyond this limit, youâ€™ll receive a `time_too_far` error response. Additionally, you cannot schedule more than 30 messages to post within a 5-minute window to the same channel. Exceeding this will result in a `restricted_too_many` error.\n\nThe response includes the `scheduled_message_id` assigned to your message. Use it with the [`chat.deleteScheduledMessage`](/methods/chat.deleteScheduledMessage) method to delete the message before it is sent.\n\nFor details on formatting, usage in threads, and rate limiting, check out [`chat.postMessage`](/methods/chat.postMessage) documentation.\n\n## Channels\n\nYou **must** specify a public channel, private channel, or an IM channel with the `channel` argument. Each one behaves slightly differently based on the authenticated user's permissions and additional arguments:\n\n#### Post to a channel\n\nYou can either pass the channel's name (`#general`) or encoded ID (`C123456`), and the message will be posted to that channel. The channel's ID can be retrieved through the [channels.list](/methods/channels.list) API method.\n\n#### Post to a DM\n\nPass the IM channel's ID (`D123456`) or a user's ID (`U123456`) as the value of `channel` to post to that IM channel as the app. The IM channel's ID can be retrieved through the [im.list](/methods/im.list) API method.\n\nYou might receive a `channel_not_found` error if your app doesn't have permission to enter into an IM with the intended user.",
