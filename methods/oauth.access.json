  "desc": "Exchanges a temporary OAuth verifier code for an access token.\n\n**This is a legacy method only used by classic Slack apps.** [Use `oauth.v2.access`](/methods/oauth.v2.access) for [new Slack apps](/authentication/basics).\n\nThis method allows you to exchange a temporary OAuth `code` for an API access token.\n\nThis is the third step of the [OAuth authentication flow](/authentication).\n\nWe strongly recommend supplying the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, as discussed [in RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).\n\nIf at all possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request.\n\n**Keep your tokens secure**. Do not share tokens with users or anyone else.\n\nWhen used with a legacy workspace app, this method's response differs significantly.\n\nA potential gotcha: while `redirect_uri` is optional, it is _required_ if your app passed it as a parameter to `oauth/authorization` in the first step of the OAuth flow.\n\nThe response schema for this step of OAuth differs depending on [the scopes](/scopes) requested and the type of application used. When asking for the `bot` scope, you'll receive the token separately from the user token.\n\n`enterprise_id` will be populated if the installing team is part of an enterprise. Otherwise, it will be `null`.",
