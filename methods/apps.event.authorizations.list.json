  "desc": "Get a list of authorizations for the given event context. Each authorization represents an app installation that the event is visible to.\n\nThis method returns a list of authorizations for the given event specified by `event_context`. Each authorization represents an app installation that the event is visible to.\n\n### How do I find an `event_context` to call this method with? \n\nYou'll receive an `event_context` identifying an event in each [event payload](/events-api#begin) sent to your app.\n\n### What do authorizations signify? \n\nAuthorizations are **installations of your app**. If your app has been installed multiple times, you'll probably have multiple authorizations for some events.\n\n### When should I call this method? \n\nCall this method to see all the installations of your app than an event is visible to. Sometimes, only certain installations have permission to know about an event.\n\n### How do I get permission to call this method \n\nCalling this method is just like any other [Web API](/web) method. However, since this method lists **multiple installations** of your app, you'll need an **app-level token**.\n\nAn app-level token represents your app as a _whole_, not just a single installation.\n\nYou'll obtain that app-level token by going to your [app config](/apps) and scrolling down to the App-Level Tokens section on the **Basic Information** page. You can click `Generate Token and Scopes` to get the token representing your app as a whole. At the same time, you'll request the [`authorizations:read`](/scopes/authorizations:read) scope.",
