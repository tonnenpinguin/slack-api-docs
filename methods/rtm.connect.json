  "desc": "Starts a Real Time Messaging session.\n\nThis method begins a Real Time Messaging API session and reserves your application a specific URL with which to connect via websocket.\n\nUnlike [`rtm.start`](/methods/rtm.start), this method is focused only on connecting to the RTM API.\n\nUse this method in conjunction with other Web API methods like [`channels.list`](/methods/channels.list), [`users.list`](/methods/users.list), and [`team.info`](/methods/team.info) to build a full picture of the team or workspace you're connecting on behalf of.\n\nPlease consult the [RTM API documentation](/rtm) for full details on using the RTM API.\n\n[New Slack apps](/authentication/basics) may not use any Real Time Messaging API method. Create a [classic app](/rtm#classic) and [use the V1 Oauth flow](/docs/oauth) to use RTM.\n\nFor most applications, [Socket Mode](/apis/connections/socket) is a better way to communicate with Slack.\n\nThis method returns a WebSocket Message Server URL and limited information about the team:\n\nThe `url` property contains a WebSocket Message Server URL. Connecting to this URL will initiate a Real Time Messaging session. These URLs are only valid for 30 seconds, so connect quickly!\n\nThe `self` property contains a small amount of information concerning the connecting user â€” an `id` and their `name`.\n\nThe `team` attribute also houses brief information about the team, including its `id`, `name`, `domain`, and if it's part of an [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise-grid), the corresponding `enteprise_id`.",
