  "desc": "Gets reactions for an item.\n\nThis method returns a list of all reactions for a single item (file, file comment, channel message, group message, or direct message).\n\nAn item will always have a `type` property, while the other properties depend on the type of item. The possible types are:\n\n- **`message`** : the item will have a `message` property containing a [message object](/docs/messages) and a `channel` property containing the channel ID for the message\n- **`file`** : this item will have a `file` property containing a [file object](/types/file)\n- **`file_comment`** : the item will have a `file` property containing the [file object](/types/file) and a `comment` property containing the file comment\n\nThe `users` array in the `reactions` property will always contain the authenticated user, but might not always contain all users that have reacted. The value of `count`, however, will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than `users.length`).",
