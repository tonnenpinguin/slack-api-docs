## Usage info

This method returns [member](#member_analytics_fields) and [conversation](#conversation_analytics_fields) analytics data presented as new-line delimited JSON files, compressed with _gzip_.

Each response contains a file with analytics data for a single day.

This [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).

Analytics data is available dating back to January 1st, 2020.

Historical data is not recomputed when a workspace and its accompanying member engagement data is added to or removed from an organization. Similarly, if a member is removed from a workspace, the data returned by the API will not update historical engagement data to reflect only the workspaces the member is currently a part of. This behavior **differs** from the _Analytics Dashboard_ in Org and Team settings, which does consider historical changes in its calculation of 30 day and all time metrics.

The `date` argument is **required** when requesting daily analytics data. It represents the date in UTC corresponding to the analytics data you're requesting. Omit this argument when setting `only_metadata` to `true`, as metadata cannot be filtered by date.

The `type` argument is **required**. It represents type of analytics data you are requesting. Currently, the API supports `member` (what users do in workspaces) or `public_channel` (what happens in conversations) analytics.

When setting `type` to `public_channel`, you may also use the `only_metadata` boolean argument, which changes the response entirely to give you metadata about the public channels appearing in your conversation analytics. Omit the `date` parameter when using this mode.

This method is almost completely unlike other [Web API](/web) methods you encounter. It doesn't return `application/json` with the traditional `"ok": true` response on success, though you'll find `"ok": false` on failure.

Instead, it returns a single file, often very large, containing JSON objects that are separated by newlines and then compressed with `application/gzip`.

To open the successful response and utilize the data, you must first store and decompress the response. Some tools may parse new line-separated JSON for you with ease, while other tools will require that you first split each new line separated "row" into its own separate JSON object before being deserialized.

After decompression, the file returned in the response will look something like the following, depending on the type of analytics requested.

#### Member analytics response 

Here are 3 example lines of JSON you would find after decompressing a member analytics file. Each line provides information about a different user.

```
{"enterprise_id":"E5UBAR8CH","date":"2020-10-05","user_id":"W0POSID23ID","email_address":"rbrautigan@example.org","is_guest":false,"is_billable_seat":false,"is_active":false,"is_active_ios":false,"is_active_android":false,"is_active_desktop":false,"reactions_added_count":0,"messages_posted_count":0,"channel_messages_posted_count":0,"files_added_count":0,"is_active_apps":true,"is_active_workflows":true,"is_active_slack_connect":true,"total_calls_count":15,"slack_calls_count":12,"slack_huddles_count":3,"search_count":223,"date_claimed":1584810430}

```

To be extra helpful, here's one of those lines formatted a little prettier:

```

#### Public channel analytics response 

This example shows 3 lines of decompressed public channel analytics. Each line provides information about activity in a single public channel.

```

		{
			"name": "Away Org",
			"domain": "away.enterprise.slack.com"
		}
	],
	"date": "2020-11-14"
}
```

#### Public channel metadata response 

Uncompressed, you'll find each public channel's metadata on a single line like so:

```
{"channel_id":"CNGL0K091","name":"tomorrow","topic":"I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today","description":"What do you want to do tomorrow?","date":"2020-11-14"}
{"channel_id":"CNGG2KB92","name":"announcements","topic":"What's new with what you do","description":"Company announcements, edicts, and mandates","date":"2020-11-14"}
{"channel_id":"CNGZ5K595","name":"teds","topic":"'No you meant the other ted' - @ted","description":"A channel just for teds, by teds.","date":"2020-11-14"}
```

And here's that last one printed pretty for you:

```
{
	"channel_id": "CNGZ5K595",
	"name": "teds",
	"topic": "'No you meant the other ted' - @ted",
	"description": "A channel just for teds, by teds.",
	"date": "2020-11-14"
}
```

#### Conversation analytics fields 

At this time, these analytics are only available for **public channels**. Archived and deleted channels are **not** included.

The account associated with the token making the request must have the _ **Public Channel Management permission** _. By default, the only account with this permission is an organization's primary owner.

If you need more metadata about these public channels, you can quickly fetch it by setting `metadata_only` to `true`. [Learn more about the information available](#metadata_only).

| Field | Example | About |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enterprise_id` | `EJB3MZFLM` | Immutable, unique id for the Grid Organization |
| `originating_team` | `{"team_id":"T4C3G041C","name":"arcane"}` | A JSON object with the `team_id` and `name` of the workspace that created this public channel |
| `channel_id` | `CNGL0K091` | The unique id belonging to this channel. The [`metadata_only` mode](#metadata_only) will give you information like the channel's name |
| `channel_type` | `single_workspace_channel` | Indicates which kind of public channel this is: `single_workspace_channel`, `multi_workspace_channel`, or `org_wide_channel`. |
| `visibility` | `public` | Indicates whether the channel is `public` or `private`. Only public channel analytics is available at this time. |
| `shared_with` | `[{"team_id":"T123456","name":"pentameter"},{"team_id":"E123457","name":"markov corp"}]` | Indicates which, if any, workspaces in the same organization this channel is shared with. Presented as an array of JSON objects containing a `team_id` and a `name`. Only works with `channel_type` set to `multi_channel_workspace`. One of the included `team_id` values corresponds to the organization itself, such as this `E123457` example. |
| `is_shared_externally` | `false` | A boolean value revealing whether the channel is shared with workspaces outside of this organization when set to `true`. |
| `externally_shared_with_organizations` | `[{"name":"Away Org","domain":"away.enterprise.slack.com"}]` | Indicates which, if any, external organizations this channel is shared with. Presented as an array of JSON objects containing an organization `name` and a slack `domain`. Only works with `is_shared_externally` set to `true`. |
| `date_created` | `1452719593` | The date and time the channel was first created, presented in seconds since the epoch (UNIX time). |
| `date_last_active` | `1584820530` | The date and time the channel last had a message posted in it, presented in seconds since the epoch (UNIX time). |
| `total_members_count` | `7` | A count of total full members & guests |
| `full_members_count` | `6` | A count of people in this channel who have a Full Member account. |
| `guest_member_count` | `1` | A count of people in this channel who have a guest account. |
| `messages_posted_count` | `223` | A count of total messages posted, including messages from apps and integration on the given day |
| `messages_posted_by_members_count` | `193` | A count of total messages posted from Slack Members & guests (human users only) on the given day |
| `members_who_posted_count` | `3` | A count of the unique number of human users (guests & full members) who posted a message on the given day |
| `members_who_viewed_count` | `225` | A count of the unique human users (guests & full members) who read a message on the given day |
| `reactions_added_count` | `23` | A count of emoji reactions left on any message in channel on that given day by human users |
| `date` | `2020-11-14` | The day in question for the query; the date requested by user for usage metrics |

#### Public channel metadata 

If you're retrieving conversation analytics but want to know more than just the ID of each channel, you can issue a separate request to retrieve bulk metadata about the public channels in the analytics report.

The response is in line-delimited JSON, similar to all other responses in this method, with each line containing an object with these fields. The same [`admin.analytics:read`](/scopes/admin.analytics:read) scope used typically in this method is all you need to retrieve this data.

| Field | Example | About |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel_id` | `CAGL0K091` | The channel's unique identifier—the very same used in the analytics above |
| `name` | `ama` | The latest name of the channel |
| `topic` | `Are Jack Kerouac's paragraphs too long?` | The latest channel topic |
| `description` | `Ask our editors all about their favorite literature` | A longer description about the purpose of the channel |
| `date` | `2020-11-14` | These details are current as of this date, which is also when you're making this API call |

## Practical usage example 

To quickly decompress a file and view the JSON directly, use a cURL command like:

```
curl "https://slack.com/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "date=2020-11-03&type=member" | gunzip -c > member_analytics_2020_11_03.json
```

...and you'll have a `member_analytics_2020_11_03.json` file in the current operating directory. In some organizations the decompressed size can be quite large. Take care that you have the disk or memory space you need to store and process these files.

Here's an example for conversation analytics:

```
curl "https://slack.com/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "date=2021-01-04&type=public_channel" | gunzip -c > public_channel_analytics_2021_01_04.json
```

And another for channel metadata to accompany that conversation analytics request—note that we omit `date`.

```
curl "https://slack.com/api/admin.analytics.getFile" -d "type=public_channel&metadata_only=true" | gunzip -c > public_channel_metadata_2021_01_04.json
```

## Example responses

### Common successful response

A gzipped new-line delimited JSON file presented with a `Content-type: application/gzip` HTTP header. An example file name is `Slack Corp Member Analytics 2020-08-01.json.gz`

### Common error response

Typical Web API error response is a JSON response with a `Content-type: application/json` HTTP header.

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "org_level_email_display_disabled"
}
```

| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
