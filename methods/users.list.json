  "desc": "Lists all users in a Slack team.\n\nThis method returns a list of all users in the workspace. This includes deleted/deactivated users.\n\nReturns a list of [paginated](/docs/pagination) [user objects](/types/user), in no particular order.\n\n## Profile\n\nThe profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied in the default profile fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `real_name`,`email`, `skype`, and the `image_*` fields. Data that has not been supplied may not be present at all, may be null or may contain an empty string (`\"\"`).\n\nA user's custom profile fields may be discovered using [`users.profile.get`](/methods/users.profile.get).\n\n## Email addresses\n\n<ts-icon class=\"ts_icon_square_warning\"></ts-icon> **Accessing email addresses**  \nThe [`users:read.email`](/scopes/users:read.email) OAuth scope is now required to access the `email` field in [user objects](/types/user) returned by the [`users.list`](/methods/users.list) and [`users.info`](/methods/users.info) web API methods. [`users:read`](/scopes/users:read) is no longer a sufficient scope for this data field. [Learn more](/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access).\n\nApps created after January 4th, 2017 must request _both_ the `users:read` and `users:read.email` [OAuth permission scopes](/docs/oauth-scopes) when using the [OAuth app installation flow](/authentication) to enable access to the `email` field of user objects returned by this method.\n\n## Pagination\n\nThis method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.\n\nResponses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.\n\nSee [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.\n\n## Presence\n\nRetrieving a workspace's presence with this method is now deprecated. Use [`users.getPresence`](/methods/users.getPresence) or [presence subscriptions](/docs/presence-and-status#subcriptions) instead.",
