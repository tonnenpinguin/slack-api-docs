While the yielded files will still be redacted, you'll gain the `id` of the files so that you can delete or revoke them.\n\n### Types \n\nThe file types you may encounter include (but are not limited to):\n\n- `all` - All files\n- `spaces` - Posts\n- `snippets` - Snippets\n- `images` - Image files\n- `gdocs` - Google docs\n- `zips` - Zip files\n- `pdfs` - PDF files",
