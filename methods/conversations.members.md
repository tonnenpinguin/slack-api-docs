## Arguments

Required arguments

`token`

[token](/authentication/token-types)

_·_Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**Example**
`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

`channel`

string

_·_Required

ID of the conversation to retrieve members for

**Example**
`C1234567890`

Optional arguments

`cursor`

string

_·_Optional

Paginate through collections of data by setting the `cursor` parameter to a `next_cursor` attribute returned by a previous request's `response_metadata`. Default value fetches the first "page" of the collection. See [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more detail.

**Example**
`dXNlcjpVMDYxTkZUVDI=`

`limit`

number

_·_Optional

The maximum number of items to return. Fewer than the requested number of items may be returned, even if the end of the users list hasn't been reached.

**Default**
`100`

**Example**
`20`

## Usage info

This [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method returns a paginated list of members party to a [conversation](/types/conversation).

Returns a list of user IDs belonging to the members in a conversation.

## Pagination

This method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.

Responses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.

See [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Typical paginated success response

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "members": [
        "U023BECGF",
        "U061F7AUR",
        "W012A3CDE"
    ],
    "response_metadata": {
        "next_cursor": "e3VzZXJfaWQ6IFcxMjM0NTY3fQ=="
    }
}
```

### Common error response

Typical error response when an invalid cursor is provided

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "invalid_cursor"
}
```

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
