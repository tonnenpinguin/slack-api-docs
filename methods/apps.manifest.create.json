Read our [guide to app manifests](/reference/manifests) to learn how create or reuse them.\n\nIf you receive an `invalid_manifest` response when trying to use any App Manifest API, it indicates that the manifest you supplied didn't match the [correct schema](/reference/manifests#fields).\n\nTo better locate the problem with your manifest, the `invalid_manifest` error should be accompanied by an `errors` array:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"ok\": false,\n\t\"error\": \"invalid_manifest\",\n\t\"errors\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"Event Subscription requires either Request URL or Socket Mode Enabled\",\n\t\t\t\"pointer\": \"/settings/event_subscriptions\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"Interactivty requires a Request URL\",\n\t\t\t\"pointer\": \"/settings/interactivity\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"Interactivity requires Socket Mode enabled\",\n\t\t\t\"pointer\": \"/settings/interactivity\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nEach of the items in this array contain a `message` which describes the problem, and a `pointer` which indicates the problem's location within your supplied manifest. Use these two pieces of info to correct your manifest and try again.",
