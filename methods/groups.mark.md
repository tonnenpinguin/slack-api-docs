## Notices

**Information about required scopes**  
This [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method's required scopes depend on the type of channel-like object you're working with. To use the method, you'll need at least one of the `channels:`, `groups:`, `im:` or `mpim:` scopes corresponding to the conversation type you're working with.

## Arguments

Required arguments

`token`

[token](/authentication/token-types)

_·_Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**Example**
`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

`channel`

string

_·_Required

Channel or conversation to set the read cursor for.

**Example**
`C012345678`

`ts`

string

_·_Required

Unique identifier of message you want marked as most recently seen in this conversation.

**Example**
`1593473566.000200`

## Usage info

This method moves the read cursor in a conversation for whomever owns the token used in the request. We don't know why bot users would want to move their read cursor but it can be done.

The associated user must be a member of the channel.

After making this call, the mark is saved to the database and broadcast via the message server to all open connections for the calling user.

Don't make calls to this method very often. When needing to mark a read position, a client should set a timer before making the call. In this way, any further updates needed during the timeout will not generate extra calls (just one per channel). This is useful for when reading scroll-back history, or following a busy live channel. A timeout of 5 seconds is a good starting point.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Typical success response

```
{
    "ok": true
}
```

### Common error response

Typical error response

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "invalid_auth"
}
```

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

 |
| `invalid_arg_name` |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
