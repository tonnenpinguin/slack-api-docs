  "desc": "Adds a reaction to an item.\n\nThis method adds a reaction (emoji) to a message. Now that [file threads](/changelog/2018-05-file-threads-soon-tread#whats_changed) work the way you'd expect, the `file` and `file_comment` arguments are deprecated. Specify only `channel` and `timestamp` instead.\n\nFor Unicode emoji that support [skin tone modifiers](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-modifier-sequence/), `name` may indicate a modifier by appending `::skin-tone-` and a number from 2 to 6, like, `thumbsup::skin-tone-6` or `wave::skin-tone-3`. This will add a reaction with the base emoji and the specified skin color.\n\nAfter making this call, the reaction is saved and [a `reaction_added` event](/events/reaction_added) is broadcast via the [Events](/events-api) and [RTM](/rtm) APIs.\n\nA `not_reactable` error is thrown when we decline the opportunity to attach your app's personally selected emoji reaction to a file or file comment. It's not because of how your app feels, it's because that approach is retired. Your app can express its inner reacji for any message though, by specifying `channel` and `timestamp`.",
