  "desc": "List restricted apps for an org or workspace.\n\nThis [App Management API](/admins/approvals) method lists apps restricted from installation on a workspace or org.\n\nThis method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise Grid admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Grid org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:read` page](/scopes/admin.apps:read) for more detailed instructions.\n\nThis [API method for admins](/enterprise/managing) may only be used on [Enterprise Grid](/enterprise).\n\n**Note:** `enterprise_id` and `team_id` cannot be used together.\n\n- Passing `enterprise_id` will return the list of org-wide restricted apps.\n- Passing `team_id` will return the apps restricted for that specific workspace.\n\nThe `developer_type` in each app helpfully describes its origin.\n\n- `internal` - the app was developed as part of this enterprise grid or workspace\n- `third_party` - the app was developed by a third party, such as (but not limited to) those found in the [Slack app directory](https://slack.com/apps).\n- `slack` - the app was built with love by Slack.
