## Notices

**Information about required scopes**  
This [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method's required scopes depend on the type of channel-like object you're working with. To use the method, you'll need at least one of the `channels:`, `groups:`, `im:` or `mpim:` scopes corresponding to the conversation type you're working with.

## Usage info

This [Conversations API](/docs/conversations-api) method returns information about a workspace [conversation](/types/conversation).

Returns a [conversation object](/types/conversation), which could be a public channel, private channel, direct message, multi-person direct message, depending completely on the `channel` ID and the permissions granted to your token.

Some fields in the response, like `unread_count` and `unread_count_display`, are included for DM conversations only.

## Example responses

### Common successful response

Typical success response for a public channel. (Also, a response from a private channel and a multi-party IM is very similar to this example.)

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "channel": {
        "id": "C012AB3CD",
        "name": "general",

}
```

### Alternate response

Typical success response for a 1:1 direct message

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "channel": {
        "id": "C012AB3CD",
        "created": 1507235627,
        "is_im": true,
        "is_org_shared": false,
        "user": "U27FFLNF4",
        "last_read": "1513718191.000038",
        "latest": {
            "type": "message",
            "user": "U5R3PALPN",
            "text": "Psssst!",
            "ts": "1513718191.000038"
        },

        "locale": "en-US",
        "priority": 0.043016851216706
    }
}
```

### Alternate response

When using the method with the `include_num_members` parameter, we return a `num_members` field

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "channel": {
        "id": "C012AB3CD",
        "created": 1507235627,
        "is_im": true,
        "is_org_shared": false,
        "user": "U27FFLNF4",

        "latest": {
            "type": "message",
            "user": "U5R3PALPN",
            "text": "Psssst!",
            "ts": "1513718191.000038"
        },
        "unread_count": 0,
        "unread_count_display": 0,
        "is_open": true,
        "locale": "en-US",
        "priority": 0.043016851216706,
        "num_members": 2
    }
}
```

### Common error response

Typical error response when a channel cannot be found

```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "channel_not_found"
}
```

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended.
 |
| `superfluous_charset` | 
The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous.
